# Promoting Accuracy in Low-amplification Histopathology Grading, using the BHI dataset
This repository include a project, which is primarily aimed to promote accuracy in the BHI dataset. Auccuracy of this dataset is usually ~85% in literature. The issue of low accuracy is due to the low amplification of whole slide scanner and pathed-based grading, and thus each patch's resolution is as little as 50x50 PPI
The code in this repository will be released with doi and probably included in a coming publishment

## A typo
A very first notebook named testing set as validation set, and vice versa. This typo was inherited to other notebooks.
